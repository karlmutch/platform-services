# The ingress block is used to route requests using path prefix strings.  The downstream
# example uses the protoc file package name and then followed by the name of the service
# from the same protoc file with a dot seperator, a gRPC standard.  The trailing /.* is Istio 
# version specific to 0.7.1 and is being changed on a regular basis, it indicates prefix based
# matching but will change in the future to using a Gateway approach, please read
# https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress.html
#
# URL paths for formed in gRPC using '[package].[service]/[method]'. gRPC documentation
# on the topic can be found at, https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md
#
# The empty prefix is used to allow the default route to the experiment service
# so that reflection, and health checking is defaulted to it.
